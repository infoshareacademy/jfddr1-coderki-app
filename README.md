# jfddr1-coderki-app

### HELLO!

Welcome to repository of our awsome Project ðŸ¥³, coded during course for Junior Front-End Developer orginized by infoShare Academy.
This repo was prepared by a team of three fearless novice programmers - Corderki ðŸ˜….

## Intro

In the beggining ... there was C H A O S !! ðŸ˜±
But then .. our GOD-MichaÅ‚ came and said - "Ladies, get yourself together!" and this is how we moved from panic ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± to brainstorming... from brainstorming to [designing](https://www.figma.com/file/Vdc9NAoXsnLe1xI7zgxeLe/Home-Manager?node-id=44%3A0)... and ... from designing to coding... This is how our app arose from ashes. Do not stop yourself and try it out ðŸ˜Š!
